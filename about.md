### `whoami`
I am a 2nd year student currently studying <span class="not-error">Computing at Imperial College London</span>. Just over 2 more years before I'm done with my degree(s) and able to move on to more interesting things....
 
When I'm coding, I'll almost always be using ðŸ’™**Python (and <a href="my github vimrc">VIM</a>)**ðŸ’™, but I have used a wide range of other programming languages and tools since **I started programming around 6 years ago**. These range from using cloud based technologies, such as **GCP and AWS**, to **JAVA (8-11)** for most of my university projects and **C++ (11-14) and C** for low level things, amongst many other things. Web dev is fun too (I'm loving <a href="typescript github">Typescript</a> at the moment).

After working under <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman">Gerard Gorman</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.kelly">Paul Kelly</a> at IC last summer as a software research intern, I have become very interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. This was in part due to Gerard letting me borrow his copy of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron (which I am yet to return), which is an absolutely amazing book. I have worked on a number of awesome ML and Data Science projects since then:

- a
- b
- c
- d

This has led me to being offered the **Data Science and Machine Learning intern position at HSBC** for the summer of 2019. 

Check out a more comprehensive CV if you're interested.

If you want to discuss anything I've mentioned above, add me on (fb logo here). For more formal project proposals etc. contact me at (email 1) or (more preferably) (email 2). I've attached my email addresses as images to prevent any annoying crawlers/scrapers from capturing them and spamming me. Sorry for the inconvenience ðŸ˜‡.
